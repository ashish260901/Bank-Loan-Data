ðŸ“Š Bank Loan Data Analysis
ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing Bank Loan Data to extract useful insights about loan applications, funded amounts, payments received, and overall borrower trends. The goal is to combine SQL-based reporting with Tableau visualizations to build an end-to-end data analysis workflow.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used
           Kaggle â†’ Dataset source
           MySQL Workbench â†’ Data storage and SQL queries
           Tableau â†’ Interactive dashboards and visualizations
           MS Word â†’ Documented SQL queries and results

ðŸ“‚ Project Workflow
        Dataset Collection
           Downloaded the dataset from Kaggle.
        Data Cleaning & Preparation
           Checked for errors, inconsistencies, and missing values.
           Ensured data types and formatting were correct.
        Database Setup
           Uploaded the dataset into MySQL Workbench.
           Created structured queries to analyze different aspects of the loan data.
        SQL Analysis
           Loan Applications (Total, Monthly, MoM Growth)
           Funded Amount & Payments Received
           Average Interest Rate & Debt-to-Income Ratio
           Good Loans vs. Bad Loans
           Loan Status Breakdown
           Trends by Issue Date, Region, Loan Term, Employment Length, Loan Purpose, and Home Ownership
        Documentation
           Compiled SQL queries and results in a Word report for reference.
        Visualization
           Built an interactive Tableau Dashboard with three main sections:
              Summary â†’ KPIs and overall metrics
              Overview â†’ Monthly and regional trends
              Details â†’ Purpose-wise and borrower profile analysis

ðŸ“ˆ Results & Insights
        Identified monthly growth trends in loan applications and funded amounts.
        Segmented loans into Good vs. Bad categories for better risk assessment.
        Discovered regional differences in loan distribution.
        Highlighted borrower patterns by loan purpose, employment, and home ownership.

ðŸš€ Conclusion
This project demonstrates the complete cycle of data analysis â€“ from data cleaning and SQL reporting to dashboard visualization. It provides both technical insights (through SQL queries) and business-friendly insights (through Tableau dashboards).
